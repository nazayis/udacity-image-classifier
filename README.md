## Dataset
The project utilizes the [Oxford 102 Category Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html), which includes images of 102 different flower categories. This dataset provides a diverse range of flower images, allowing for robust training and accurate classification.

## Key Features
- AI-powered image classification.
- Trained on a comprehensive dataset of 102 flower species.

## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning models for image classification.
